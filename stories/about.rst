**You want to contact us** if

- you need a database application and can't find any satisfying stock
  solution
- you don't expect a finished product and want to help with analysis
  and testing
- you want a stable and long-term solution
- you want to remain the master of your data even if our collaboration
  comes to an end
- you want the software created by our common efforts to be shared
  with others as open source software under a free license.


**We are small** and will remain so.  During the first decade we
satisfied our customers with only one full-time developer. But our
customers had more projects than a single person can deliver.  Since
2015 we employ a freelance assistant in Douz (Tunisia) to help Luc
with his job with Lino. Since 2017 we employ a full-time developer in
Tallinn (Estonia).  See also :doc:`team`.

**We believe** that Lino and our business model have a future that
goes beyond the career of a few developers.  Our strategy is to follow
a gentle and sustainable way, helping Lino to grow into a community
project.  See also :doc:`views`.
