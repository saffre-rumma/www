About us
========

**Rumma and Ko** is a limited private share company (osa√ºhing) under
Estonian law.  Since 2001 we do development, maintenance and end-user
support of `free <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software>`__
customized database applications.

Since 2009 we are investing most of our energy into Lino_, a framework
which combines the powers of Django_ with those of ExtJS_.

.. _Lino: http://www.lino-framework.org
.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.org
.. _ExtJS: http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/

During the first decade we satisfied our customers with only one
full-time developer. But our customers had more projects than a single
person can deliver.  Since 2015 we employ a freelance assistant in
Douz (Tunisia) to help Luc with his job with Lino. Since 2017 we
employ another full-time developer in Tallinn (Estonia).

We believe that Lino and our business model have a future that goes
beyond the career of a few developers.  Our strategy is to follow a
gentle and sustainable way, making Lino grow into a community project.


**You should contact us** if 

- you have some concrete need for a customized database application
- you want a professional, stable and long-term solution
- you have a limited budget, but you are ready to help with analysis
  and testing, and you don't expect a finished product
- you want to remain the master of your data even if our collaboration
  stops for some reason


**We are hiring!** If you have experience with programming in Python
and Django, and if you are interested in working at home part-time or
full-time, then check whether you fit as a :doc:`coredev`.
