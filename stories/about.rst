About us

**Rumma and Ko** is a limited private share company (osa√ºhing) under
Estonian law.  National registry number `10501849
<http://www.teatmik.ee/et/info/10501849>`_

Since 2001 we do development, maintenance and end-user
support of `free <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software>`__
customized database applications.

Since 2009 we are investing most of our energy into
`Lino </lino>`__, a framework
which combines the powers of Django_ with those of ExtJS_.

.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.org
.. _ExtJS: http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/

During the first decade we satisfied our customers with only one
full-time developer. But our customers had more projects than a single
person can deliver.  Since 2015 we employ a freelance assistant in
Douz (Tunisia) to help Luc with his job with Lino. Since 2017 we
employ another full-time developer in Tallinn (Estonia).  See also
:doc:`team`.

We believe that Lino and our business model have a future that goes
beyond the career of a few developers.  Our strategy is to follow a
gentle and sustainable way, making Lino grow into a community project.
