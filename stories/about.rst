.. title: About Rumma & Ko Ltd

**Rumma and Ko OÜ** is a limited private share company (osaühing)
under Estonian law.  Owners are the Belgian software developer Luc
Saffre and his wife Ly Rumma.  National registry number `10501849
<http://www.teatmik.ee/et/info/10501849>`_

**We are small** and will remain so.  We are a family-sized team of
three full-time developers.  See also :doc:`team`.

.. During the first decade we satisfied our customers with only one
   full-time developer. But our customers had more projects than a
   single person can deliver.  Since 2015 we employ a freelance
   assistant in Douz (Tunisia) to help Luc with his job with
   Lino. Since 2017 we employ a full-time developer in Tallinn
   (Estonia).

   We do this since 2001.  Since 2009 we invest most of our energy
   into Lino.

**We believe** that Lino has a future that goes beyond the career of a
few developers.  Our strategy is to follow a gentle and sustainable
way, helping Lino to grow into a community project.  See also
