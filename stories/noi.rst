.. title: Lino Noi


We are proud to be maintainer and service provider for `Lino Noi
<http://noi.lino-framework.org>`_, a customizable ticket management
and time tracking system to use when time is more than money.

Lino Noi is used by ourselves for managing our work on the Lino
project.

The name comes from Italian "noi" which means "we".

It can be called a `DevOps tool
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps>`_ in that it stresses
communication, collaboration, integration, automation, and measurement
of cooperation between software developers, users and other IT
professionals.

Lino Noi is in a **works for us** state, running on one production
site and waiting for its next site.
