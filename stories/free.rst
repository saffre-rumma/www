.. title: Why software should be free


**Lino is free software** and you can run a Lino site completely
without our help.  While this might seem irrelevant at first glance,
here is why this is an imporant choice.

Free software is to computers what **democracy** is to society. Free
software means democracy, proprietary software means **dictature**.

Of course it is easier to live in a dictature, as long as you obey the
rules. Managing your information using free software is **neither
cheaper nor easier** than using proprietary software.  It is a
strategical choice.

**Software must be free** because the
more your everyday life depends on computers, the more it is important
to ask who controls these computers. Your **sovereignty** is not
alienable.
