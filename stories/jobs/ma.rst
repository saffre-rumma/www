========================
Lino marketing assistant
========================

Luc loves talking about Lino, but he is not a fighter.
He has never been a good salesman.
He has no talent for convincing distrustful people why they should trust in Lino.
We never needed to fight as long as Lino was small.
But Lino is growing, and the more it grows, the more we need somebody who does that job.
