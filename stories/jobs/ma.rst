========================
Lino Marketing Assistant
========================

Until now we never needed to sell Lino because
it was being used in small organisations where trust
works on human level.
But more and more medium-sized organisations want to use Lino.
Having bigger customers requires additional work for
marketing, promotion and sales.
Lino needs somebody who does that job.

- You understand what's so cool about Lino, you know its features and
  limits.
- You have experience with managing information systems  and
  database applications.
- You understand why software must be free.
- You love explaining to others why they should choose your product.
- You feel well with writing PR texts.

**Your duties**

- review the *saffre-rumma.net* website, write content where necessary
- help us with deciding what's important
- describe workflow processes and requirements for our development team
- write regular newsletters about Lino and free software
- talk with customers and partners
