Lino Marketing Assistant
========================

Until now we never needed to sell Lino because
it was being used in small organisations where trust
works on human level.
But more and more medium-sized organisations want to use Lino.
Having bigger customers requires additional work for
customer care, marketing, promotion and sales.
Lino needs somebody who does that job.
