========================
Lino marketing assistant
========================

Luc loves talking about Lino, but he is not a fighter.
He has neither motivation nor talent for convincing distrustful people why they should trust in Lino.
He has never been a good salesman.
We never needed to fight as long as Lino was small,
but the more Lino grows, the more we need somebody who does that job.
