Project manager

We are patiently looking for the person who is going to start the
**Lino Software Foundation**.

The basic idea of this project is developed below in a few steps:

- We believe that software must be free.  A free human civilization is
  incompatible with proprietary software.

- While the free world has an operating system and an office suite,
  there is no serious free solution for organizations who want to
  invest in free *database applications*.  The market of customized
  database applications is currently dominated by a few proprietary
  giants.

- The Lino framework has the potential of becoming such a solution.
  Lino is a sign of hope for those who believe that software must be
  free.

- This potential is currently merely visible to investors and
  stakeholders.  There is much work to do to bring Lino to the next
  level so that it can grow from a project with a handful of
  developers into a reliable international infrastructure.

- Rumma & Ko wants to remain a family-sized dynamic team of creative
  developers.  We don't have the human resources for bringing Lino to
  the next level.

- Even if we *would* decide to become big ourselves, this wouldn't be
  a solution.  The role of bringing Lino to the next level must be
  played by an organization that does not have any private interest.
  A private corporation with limited responsibility is not a valid
  candidate for this job.

- That's why Lino needs a foundation or some similar legal person,
  inspired by the `PSF <https://www.python.org/psf/>`__ or the `DSF
  <https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/>`__.

Don't hesitate to contact us if you agree with our ideas and feel that
you can help Lino to become big.
