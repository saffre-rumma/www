The Lino board
==============

The **Lino board** is the central group of stakeholders who discuss
and decide about what is going on in Lino.  It is a common forum for
*users*, *developers*, *hosters* and *service providers* of the Lino
framework.

The Lino board currently has no juristic form and uses infrastructure
provided by Rumma & Ko.

Here is a list of team members who agreed to be listed in public so you
can contact them if you have questions or suggestions for the Lino board.
