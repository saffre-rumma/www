.. remark

    | Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.
    | As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.
    | Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others,
    | even to the dull and ignorant; they too have their story.
    |
