We provide professional customized database solutions to our
customers, including design, development, maintenance and end-user
support.  We invest most of our energy into Lino_, a framework that
extends Django_ with an alternative admin interfaces based on ExtJS_
and (under development) OpenUI5_.  We can look back to 16 years of
successful activity.

We have around 20 satisfied customers being handled by a small team of
core developers.  But our customers have more projects than we can
deliver.  Lino and our business model have a future that goes beyond
the career of a few developers.
