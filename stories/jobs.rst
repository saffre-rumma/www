Rumma & Ko does development, maintenance and end-user support of free
customized database applications since 2001.  Since 2009 we are
investing most of our energy into Lino_, a framework that combines the
powers of Django_ with those of ExtJS_ or OpenUI5_.  We are currently
the motor of the Lino community.

We provide **professional Lino solutions** to our customers.  We have
around 20 satisfied customers being handled by a small team of core
developers.  Our team is doing a great job with Lino, but our
customers have more projects than we can deliver.  That's why we
believe that Lino and our business model have a future that goes
beyond the career of a few developers.

Our strategy is to grow in a
**gentle, organic and sustainable** way.
We grow because *Lino* grows, not because *we* want to be big.
Besides engaging people ourselves, we also provide free **mentoring** and
encourage independent actors to learn Lino and use it to make their
own money.

Here is a list of people we clearly need.  Priority candidates are
those who have proven their skills by contributions to open-source
projects.

**Medium-term**
