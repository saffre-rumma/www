Rumma & Ko does development, maintenance and end-user support of Free
customized database applications since 2001.  We have around 20
satisfied customers being handled by only two core developers.  Since
2009 we are investing most of our energy into Lino_, a framework that
combines the powers of Django_ with those of ExtJS_.  Our team is
doing a great job with Lino, but our customers have more projects than
we can deliver. So we plan to **engage** a :doc:`system administrator
<admin>` (Estonia or Belgium), an :doc:`analyst <analyst>` (Belgium)
and more :doc:`core developers <coredev>` (worldwide) as soon as
possible.  Priority candidates are those who have proven their skills
by voluntary contributions.

We believe that Lino and our marketing model have a future that goes
beyond the career of a few developers.  Our strategy is to follow a
gentle and sustainable way, making Lino grow into a community project.
Besides engaging people ourselves, we also provide free **mentoring**
and encourage independent developers to learn Lino and use it to make
their own money.

**Medium-term**

- :doc:`uidev`
