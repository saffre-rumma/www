Rumma & Ko does development, maintenance and end-user support of free
customized database applications since 2001.  Since 2009 we are
investing most of our energy into Lino_, a framework that combines the
powers of Django_ with those of ExtJS_.  We are currently the motor of
the Lino community. 

We have around 20 satisfied customers being handled by only three core
developers.  Our team is doing a great job with Lino, but our
customers have more projects than we can deliver.

We believe that Lino and our marketing model have a future that goes
beyond the career of a few developers.  Our strategy is to follow a
**gentle, organic and sustainable** way for developing our competence
in helping our customers to use Lino and other free software.  Besides
engaging people ourselves, we also provide free **mentoring** and
encourage independent actors to learn Lino and use it to make their
own money.

Here is a list of people we clearly need.  Priority candidates are
those who have proven their skills by voluntary contributions.
