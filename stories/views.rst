.. title: Our philosophy

Some of our choices

- We want Lino to become a big community, but regarding ourselves we
  are a small organization and want to remain human size. We will
  rather multiply than become big.

- We concentrate on a limited number of products for which we can
  ensure our competence. 

- We believe that writing good software is an *art*, and that software
  developers should work and get paid like *artists*.

- We believe in `Free software
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software>`__ and refuse to use
  our spiritual work as private property.

Our strategy is to grow in a **gentle, organic and sustainable** way.
We grow because *Lino* grows, not because *we* want to be big.
Besides engaging people ourselves, we also provide free **mentoring**
and encourage independent actors to learn Lino and use it to make
their own money.

Our whole business model, incuding sales, development and maintenance
is based on these choices.  Lino solutions work best in the context of
projects where

- the need and usefulness of a database application is obvious
- the stakeholders do *not* require detailed prognoses
- motivated end-users want to improve the quality of their work
- a local project manager serves as contact between end-users and
  developers
