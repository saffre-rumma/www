The great piece of news for June is that Hamza started working
full-time for Lino.

.. TEASER_END

My first plan was to let him become our responsible for testing and
deployment and to give him #2347 (Make Lino installable using pip) or
#463 (Measure test coverage for Lino and Lino Welfare).  But a after
reading `Wir brauchen technikfeindliche Techniker!
<https://www.heise.de/developer/artikel/Wir-brauchen-technikfeindliche-Techniker-4044291.html>`__
(07.05.2018 by Eberhard Wolff for heise.de), I changed that plan and
decided to let him work on OpenUI5 together with Tonis.  Tonis is
still in parental leave until november.  And that project is our most
urgent project because it will bring very visible changes to the
endusers.  It deserves two brains.

We hope to have a first production site with OpenUI5 for the end of
this year.

I also started a new job announcement: :doc:`pm`.
