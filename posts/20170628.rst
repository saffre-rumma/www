Lino Tera got active
====================

Finally.  After long months of waiting for general questions to be
settled, this month Lydia and I started to actively develop on
:doc:`Lino Tera <tera>`.  For the first time they saw their data from
legacy system TIM as it looks in Lino.

Lydia and I had to get used to
meet with shared screen using Skype or Hangouts. I am amazed about
Lydias competence: she has no problem switching back and forth between
two fundamentally different user interfaces, she has a feeling for
finding bugs and reporting them accurately.

It is the typical workflow during this phase:

1. We prepare the site and write a first prototype
2. We invite the customer to a field visit, i.e. a meeting where we
   show what has been done, listen to the user's reaction, discuss
   about what needs to be done for next time.
3. We write a report of that visit, including a list of tasks to do.
4. Our developers work on their tasks until they are ready for an
   upgrade.
5. Restart from 2.
