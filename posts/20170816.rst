Celebrating the success of Lino Avanti
======================================

Today the main actors of `Lino Avanti
<http://avanti.lino-framework.org/>`__ met in a restaurant in Eupen
and celebrated the successful start of the project.

.. TEASER_END

Both planning and implementation were a nice example of a classical
software development project with Rumma & Ko:

- a single live meeting with users and developer in november 2016
- we write a concise document of a few pages describing the project
- the customer buys a number of credit work hours.
- we start coding, publish our work on GitHub, set up a server with a
  prototype running
- we write monthly service reports.  
- A series of *field visits*, remote shared screen meetings of
  developer and a designated key user. During this phase the
  application is incrementally being made "ready to teach"
- The customer organizes training of their users
