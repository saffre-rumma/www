**Vigala Code Camps** are a series of Python_ programming camps taking
place in Vigala_ as part of the `Europe Code Week
<http://codeweek.eu/>`_ initiative.  The next camp will be **in
October 2016** (exact dates to be confirmed).  Contact us as soon as
you consider participating.  Exact agenda and conditions are worked
out with the participants.

The one to five days lasting camps feature a unique location in a
small Estonian village between forests and bogs. Participants are
suggested a maximum of six computer hours per day. The remaining
programme consists in social and touristic activities.

We offer camps for both experienced and aspiring programmers.
Beginners will learn the Python_ programming language from scratch.
Experienced developers will learn how to use the Lino_ framework.
Participants need their own desktop computer. We will be working in a
mixture of short lessons and `pair programming
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming>`_ sessions.

Main speaker at the camps is Luc Saffre, an experienced Python
programmer. We invite and welcome assistants and other speakers to
help us increase diversity.

Vigala Code Camps are organized by `Rumma & Ko OÃœ
<http://saffre-rumma.net/>`_ because we believe that sharing our
expert knowledge at low cost will help the Lino_ community to grow and
our society to become more free.
