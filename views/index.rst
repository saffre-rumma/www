Our philosophy
==============

Some of our choices

- We are working hard for making Lino grow into a big community, but
  regarding ourselves we are a small organization and want to remain
  human size. We will rather multiply than become big.

- We concentrate on a limited number of products for which we can
  ensure our competence. 

- We believe that writing good software is an *art*, and that software
  developers should work and get paid like *artists*.

- We believe in `Free software
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software>`__ and refuse to turn
  our spiritual work into private property.


Our whole business model, incuding sales, development and maintenance
is based on these choices.  Lino solutions work best in the context of
projects where

- the need and usefulness of a database application is obvious
- the stakeholders do *not* require detailed prognoses
- motivated end-users want to improve the quality of their work
- a local project manager serves as contact between end-users and
  developers
