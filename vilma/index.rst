=================
The Vilma project
=================

This document, maintained by Rumma & Ko, is currently under
discussion.  It is a first vision with the goal of finding partners
for starting a pilot pilot in Raplamaa county (Estonia).  Please send
your suggestions and feedback to luc.saffre@gmail.com.

**Lino Vilma** might be a customized Lino application which helps
inhabitants of small rural villages for managing their public projects
and relationships.

The current project name "Vilma" is both an acronym of "village
manager" and a typical given name of 60+ aged female inhabitants of
Estonian villages.

Functional specification
========================

- Lino Vilma is visible as a **secured Internet database
  application**.

- **Every village inhabitant** gets a user account and can either log
  in directly or delegate their "voice" to somebody who represents
  them.

- Lino Vilma comes with an integrated **content and document
  management system**: Users can write blog entries and articles,
  upload photos, videos and other documents to be published on the
  website or to be shared within the community.
  This functionality is used for maintaining the **public website**,
  the village **chronicle** and the village **archive**.

- The village community can designate professional full-time,
  part-time or or volunteer **workers** who received training and have
  more rights than normal users. These are responsible for managing
  certain parts of the system.
  
- Certain users can create **polls** in order to collect opinions
  about concrete questions.  Other users (having the *poller* role)
  can ask other people and collect their answers to these polls.
 
- Lino Vilma integrates a **contact management system** for internal
  usage by trusted workers.

- Users can **discuss** among each other about public topics using
  instant messaging. The difference with existing networks is that
  their discussion is being archived and remains accessible in the
  future.
  
- Every public suggestion or complaint is introduced as a **ticket**,
  similar to issue managers or bug trackers used by open source
  software projects.  These tickets are used for project management.
  
- Users can **vote** in order to mark their support for certain
  projects.

- Users can print **reports** about opinions and projects of their
  community for discussing with other communities.
  

Goals
=====

Social:

- Increase visibility of the democratic process and
  transparency of public decisions.
- Promote and encourage voluntary engagement.
- Provide a framework for remote working.

Administrative:

- Reduce overall costs for administration of a village
- Increase quality of local politic work


Discussion
==========

- How does this idea compare with previous and other projects?
- Why do we need yet another software project?
- Why Lino as framework?


Weblinks
========

- Especially one message emerged stronger than any other both during
  the discussion at the Habitat III conference as well as in the New
  Urban Agenda: cities want and need more power- and new governance
  structures need to be established to make this happen.
